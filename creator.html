                    <div class="definiciones"> Originally intending it as a follow-up feature film to Comet, Esmail began working on the technological thriller Mr. Robot in the late 2000s, inspired in part by the 2008 financial crisis and the Arab Spring.[18][28] He has said that the main character, Elliot, is a "thinly-veiled version" of himself;[29] like Elliot, Esmail also suffers from social anxiety and is from Washington Township in New Jersey.[7][12] He was later inspired to take what he had written and create a pilot for what he imagined would be a four-or-five season show.[30] He shopped his projects around to many different television networks and began developing the show with USA Network in 2014.[31]

                        Mr. Robot premiered on the USA Network on June 24, 2015. Esmail is the creator, executive producer and head writer of the series.[32] Beginning with season two, Esmail also directed all episodes of the show; in total he directed thirty-eight of its forty-five episodes.[1] The first season of the show was critically acclaimed and Esmail himself was nominated for two Emmys, among other awards.

                        In a 2015 interview, Esmail explained the influence of his experiences as a first-generation American on his work, saying, "I tend to write about alienated figures who can't connect with others and who are kind of distant from American culture. It's not something I am consciously doing but it's something that happens to be infused inside me because of my experience growing up in America.</div>
